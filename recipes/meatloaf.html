        <img src="../images/meat.jpg">
        <p>I never thought I could make a moist meatloaf without bread crumbs until I made this recipe! 
            I definitely do not miss the bread anymore! </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Meatloaf:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
            <li>6 medium mushrooms, minced</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>6 slices bacon, cut in half</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups tomato sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons reduced-sugar ketchup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>Mix together ground beef, ground pork, mushrooms, onion, mozzarella cheese, egg, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl until well combined. Form into a loaf shape and place in the middle of the prepared baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix together tomato sauce, ketchup, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper for sauce in a small bowl; pour over the meatloaf. Place bacon slices on top of the meatloaf.</li>
            <li>Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven until bacon is cooked and meatloaf is no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
