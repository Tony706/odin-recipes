        <h2>Delicious and very easy to make. You can use 3 to 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon cubes. Also works well with half as much cream cheese if you don't want it too rich. </h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons chopped onion</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons margarine</li>

        </ul>
